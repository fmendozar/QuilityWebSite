										<h2>Task 2: Calming down during an anxiety attack</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This task was equally important to include because in our research anxiety was noted as one of the reasons OCD is so disruptive to people’s lives. Therefore, we want our solution to help our users directly combat this anxiety. By broadening our scope and changing our task to include multiple different calming methods we can help a larger variety of people. For example, within our task to calm anxiety we can allow our users to play calming music, call a friend, initiate a meditation phase, play nature noises, etc. The user can choose which calming method works for them.</p>
